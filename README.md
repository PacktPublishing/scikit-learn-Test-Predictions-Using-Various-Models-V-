It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Scikit-learn has evolved as a robust library for machine learning applications in Python with support for a wide range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms.

This course begins by taking you through videos on linear models; with scikit-learn, you will take a machine learning approach to linear regression. As you progress, you will explore logistic regression. Then you will build models with distance metrics, including clustering. You will also look at cross-validation and post-model workflows, where you will see how to select a model that predicts well. Finally, you'll work with Support Vector Machines to get a rough idea of how SVMs work, and also learn about the radial basis function (RBF) kernel.
